					The journey of life came on 11th August, 1996.This was the day when my parents blessed me with the name Harsh Bajaj.I am the eldest sibling in my family and hence had a sense of responsibilty towards my younger siblings.I hail from Hyderabad,Telangana.<br></br>
					I had my schooling in Hyderabad itself at All Saint's High School.This institution played a very important role in shaping my character and preparing me for my future.In 2012 I completed my schooling.<br></br>
					Coaching for JEE was taken by me at Ramaiah IIT Study Circle which is a complete package for one appearing for JEE.I owe a lot to this institute.<br></br>
					<b>Presently, I am a first year Undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology,Kharagpur in the department of Civil Engineering enrolled in its B.Tech course.</b>
