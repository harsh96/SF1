				<h2> Coding </h2>
				<p>
					In my first year at kharagpur I learnt to code in C language as a part of my curriculum .This also induced interest in me towards coding and hence I started competetive coding on various sites like codechef and hackkerank.<br>
					Also I developed interest in web designing in my second semester and was a part of the Alumni-Cell Web Team.
				</p>
				<h2> Tennis </h2>
				<p>
					I have a great interest in Lawn Tennis and love this sport a lot. I am also a part of NSO tennis at IIT Kharagpur.
				</p>
				<h2> Robotics</h2>
				<p>
					Robotics was taken up by me as a passion . This also helped me and my team securing the fourth postiton in an event at Kshitij 2k15 at IIT Kharagpur.
